          <h1>Logo Design</h1>
          <p>Logo design is one of my favourite design practices. It is the primary way a business can communicate effectively its message in an immidiate fashion. It is a huge part of the identity and takes creative thinking, an eye for design, and knowledge about branding to create an effective logo. This work was a professional job for the Kanata Beaverbrook Community Association(KBCA). The KBCA is a gerden community. The community is distinct for its many natural paths and winding roads.  </p>
